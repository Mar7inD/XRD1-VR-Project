# XRD1-VR-Project - EscapeRoomVR

This is the 2nd out of 2 XR projects for my XDR1 course. In my 1st project you can find the blogposts reflecting the work and outcomes from both projects. The 1st project could be found [here](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XDR1-AR-Project). The blogposts could be found also below.

## Blogposts
The blogpost are separated in 4 sections. The first section is about the 1st introduction week. Week [5](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XDR1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week5_lab2.md), [6](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XDR1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week6_lab3.md), [10](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XDR1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week10_lab5.md), [11](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XDR1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week11_lab6.md) is about the AR and VR projects. Where week [4](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XDR1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week4_lab1.md) and week [9](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XDR1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week9_lab4.md) are about decisions and what lead to taking them plus some set up work. Asset references can be found there as well. The 4th section is about the personal reflection we have to give about the work on the project.
