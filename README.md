# XRD1-VR-Project - EscapeRoomVR

This is the 2nd out of 2 XR projects for my XRD1 course. In my 1st project you can find the blogposts reflecting the work and outcomes from both projects. The 1st project can be found [here](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XRD1-AR-Project). The blogposts can be found also below.

## Blogposts
The blogpost are separated in 4 sections. 

Week [1](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XRD1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week1_introduction.md) is about the 1st introduction week. 

Week [4](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XRD1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week4_lab1.md) and [9](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XRD1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week9_lab4.md) are about decisions and what lead to taking them plus some set up work. Asset references can be found there as well. 

Week [5](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XRD1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week5_lab2.md), [6](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XRD1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week6_lab3.md), [10](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XRD1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week10_lab5.md), [11](https://github.com/Mar7inD/XRD1-AR-Project/blob/main/blogposts/week11_lab6.md) are about the AR and VR projects. 

The 4th section is about the personal reflection we have to give about the work on the projects.

### Video - EscapeRoomVR
- [Video]()

### Use Case

Setting up escape room is costly and sometimes experience could not match each game. It takes time to rearange the environment. With VR this could be easily avoided as the rearangement happens instantly, the cost is the headset and electricity. 

### Tools Used
- [Unity 2022.3](https://unity.com/)
  - AR Foundation, ARKit XR Plugin, XR Management
